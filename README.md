This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Make sure you configure the `.env` file correctly. Dev mode is more demanding and might cause worse performance, we recommend building the project to get a more accurate feel for how the app runs.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

To run the built project locally you can do,
```
yarn add serve
serve -s build
```
Inside the project root directory.
